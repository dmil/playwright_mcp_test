This is a test of the playwright MCP. I am using MCPs for the first time, annotate the code well so i can follow it, keep it as simple as possible. Make sample code that does the following:

- Use Playwright MCP.
- Navigate to https://omar.house.gov/.
- Find me the container with the social links (facebook, x/twitter, instagram, youtube) with the mcp
- return the selector to the container and display the links within it as a list
